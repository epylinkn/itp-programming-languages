Intro to Programming Languages 101, for Future Presidents
=========================================================

aka the "Language" in "Programming Languages"

aka "Why can't I use javascript everywhere?"

## GOAL

Get better at the one programming language you care about most
(and this might be different for everyone). Similar to how studying a
foreign language in high school gave you a different context with which
to evaluate your native tongue, we'll aim to expose you to other
programming languages with the hopes that you'll understand all of them
better.

In other words, learn to be more effective in ANY programming language!

Regardless of what language you're looking to master, this session aims
to take a step back to see how other languages work. We'll primarily
dive into a language you're likely not familiar with: Ruby! For the most
part, we'll compare with Javascript, but I promise to also sprinkle in
some examples from other languages along the way.

It's a short session, so we'll keep the examples simple with the option
to dive into more complexity at the end depending on interest.

## OUTLINE

Together we'll compare language concepts between two or three different
programming languages. In doing so, we'll learn about what composes a
programming language. We'll touch upon:

0. History
1. Syntax
2. Semantics
3. Idioms
4. Libraries
5. Tools
6. Community

## PREREQUISITES

- Aimed at the intermediate-level programmer with some experience in one
or two programming languages
- But also valuable to any novice with some programming experience and an
interest for more!

## TOOLS

- Laptop
